# Parallel-Computing-Project


Using parallelized computing, we would like to determine:

--- The appreciated products. A product is considered as appreciated if (and only if) its average rating score is at least 4.

--- The N least rated products, N being a program constant.

--- The mean and standard deviation of product (average) ratings.
